# EE321 Group R P3

The project for Group R's code in Project 3.

EE321 Project 3 Matlab Code and Figures are included. To run the Matlab code, download the full repository and run the problem-based files (pt3, pt4_1a, etc.)

Most files are the same, the primary differences are the formulas run, the number of bins run in a for loop, and the type of the main loop.


- For loops: `pt3.m`, `pt4_1a.m`, `pt4_1b.m`
- While loops: `pt4_2a.m`, `pt4_2b.m`

The two additional `*.m` files are functions which facilitate consistent plotting accross all files.
